                Mobile application written with React Native, Firebase, and
                Node.js. The application was built with 3 other students as part
                of the UCF KnightHacks club. My role was to setup the backend
                with Firebase to store user input and handle user
                authentication. I also designed and implemented some front-end
                components.  The project won best overall for the semester.
